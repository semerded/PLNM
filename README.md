<h2 id="li1">Google Drive as database</h2>
PLNM uses the Google API to use a users Google Drive as a personal database. The program will not store any data on a server/cloud other than the users Google Drive. This keeps the app completely free of any charges for the developer.
<h2>Google Drive setup procedure</h2>
When the user opens the app for the first time, the program will ask the user to log in with their Google account. The Google account is used to get access to the users Google drive. After this, the program creates a new folder in Google Drive called "com/semerded" (refering to the developer). In here you can find a README.TXT file with info about the usage of Google Drive as a database. It will also create a new folder with named "PLNM" where all the app data will be stored. The app data consists out of multiple JSON files that store the different parts of the app.
<h2>Google Drive notice</h2>
When deleting the appdata files, make sure to delete them from the bin to wipe all the data.
It is not yet tested if you can share app data file between users...

<h2>Google Drive known issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes (because of an unknown error) an already existing appdata file will be created again in the home directory. Please still report this bug to know more about the frequency of the bug.</li>
